This MatLab script is to simulate the trajectory of individual bacteria in a micropillar array (on a square lattice). 
The geometry of the pillar array is set by the pillar radius "r0" (normalized by the lateralsize of the lattice). 
The other factor determining the geometric effects is the probablity of escaping, which is given by a list "vp0."
The example trajectoreis and their mean-squared displacements are both calculated, with the latter shown as its mean and standard deviation.
